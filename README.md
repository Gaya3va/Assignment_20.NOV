# JavaScript Assignments — Q11 to Q15

This repository contains five JavaScript assignments covering synchronous execution, time-based functions, event loop behavior, and user-interactive timers.

---

## Q11 — Synchronous Code Execution
A simple demo showing that JavaScript executes code line-by-line.

**Run:**  
`node Q11.js`

---

## Q12 — Delayed Message Using setTimeout
Prints two messages immediately and one after a 2-second delay.

**Run:**  
`node Q12.js`

---

## Q13 — Loading Screen Simulation
Prints “Loading…” every second, stops after 5 seconds, and prints “Loaded successfully!”.

**Run:**  
`node Q13.js`

---

## Q14 — Debugging Event Loop Order
Demonstrates correct execution order using synchronous logs, Promises, and setTimeout.
